# Voice in Music — Observations

My experience as a mixing and mastering engineer has shaped my understanding of the voice as the most sensitive, important and communicative element in a production.

Working on full tracks and complete projects has taught me how small vocal decisions — tone, timing, space, texture — dramatically affect how a listener perceives emotion and meaning.

These insights form the foundation of my growing interest in voice technology and sound design beyond traditional music contexts.
